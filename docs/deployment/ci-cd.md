# CI/CD Pipeline

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the Basis project using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of two main workflows:
1. Development workflow (dev branch)
2. Production workflow (main branch)

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Development Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to Test Server

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup SSH
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.DEV_SERVER_SSH_KEY }}

      - name: Deploy to Test Server
        run: |
          ssh ubuntu@13.61.2.96 << 'EOF'
            cd /home/ubuntu/basis
            git pull origin dev
            pm2 restart all
          EOF
```

### Production Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup SSH
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.4
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.PROD_SERVER_SSH_KEY }}

      - name: Deploy to Production Server
        run: |
          ssh ubuntu@51.20.32.201 << 'EOF'
            cd /home/ubuntu/basis
            git pull origin main
            pm2 restart all
          EOF
```

## GitHub Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in your GitHub repository:

1. `DEV_SERVER_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for the development server
2. `PROD_SERVER_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for the production server

### Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret with its corresponding value

## Deployment Process

### Development Deployment
1. Push changes to the `dev` branch
2. GitHub Actions automatically deploys to the test server
3. Changes are tested on the development environment

### Production Deployment
1. Create a pull request from `dev` to `main`
2. Review and merge the pull request
3. GitHub Actions automatically deploys to the production server

## Monitoring Deployments

1. Check deployment status in GitHub Actions tab
2. Monitor server logs:
   ```bash
   # Frontend logs
   pm2 logs basis-frontend

   # Backend logs
   pm2 logs basis-backend
   ```
3. Check Nginx logs:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

## Rollback Process

If a deployment causes issues:

1. SSH into the affected server
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Check out the previous commit:
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
   ```
4. Restart the services:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart all
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Protection**
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require up-to-date branches

2. **Deployment Safety**
   - Always test on development first
   - Use feature branches
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for failed deployments
   - Monitor application health
   - Track deployment metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Failures**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Verify SSH key permissions
   - Check server disk space

2. **Service Issues**
   - Check PM2 status
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check application logs

3. **Network Issues**
   - Verify security group rules
   - Check DNS configuration
   - Test server connectivity
