# Project Title: My AI Trainer – Self-Learning Quiz App
## Overview:
My AI Trainer is a mobile-friendly web or mobile app that helps students learn any skill (like trigonometry) by interacting with an AI-based quiz trainer. The AI adapts to the user's knowledge level and helps them improve step by step.

## Key Requirements
### Skill Selection
-  User can open the app on their phone or browser.
- User is prompted to enter the skill/topic they want to learn.
- Example: “I want to learn trigonometry”

### Initial Assessment Interview
- The AI trainer starts with a few basic introductory questions related to the selected skill.
- User answers these questions by typing or selecting options.
- Based on these answers, the AI:
- Calculates a score (0–100 scale or star rating).
- Displays a summary of strengths and weaknesses.
- Example: "You're good with basic identities, but need to improve on trigonometric equations."

### Adaptive Quiz Logic
- The AI continues the quiz based on the user's level:
- If the user gets a question wrong:
- Show the correct answer and explain it clearly.
- Then ask a simpler question related to the same concept.
- If the user gets a question right:
- Ask a slightly harder question to push them further.

### Real-Time Feedback
- After each question, give:
- Instant feedback (correct/wrong)
- Explanation (if needed)
- Next step/question

### Progress Tracking (Optional for Phase 2)
- Show a small dashboard:
- Current level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate)
- Progress bar
- History of questions attempted
