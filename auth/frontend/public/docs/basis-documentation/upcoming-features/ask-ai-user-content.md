# Ask Questions to AI on Your Own Content=

## Requirement 
AI tool where 
- as a user I should be able to give text based inputs in forms of posts and txt files (totalling about 10 MB) to AI, 
- and should be able to ask questions based on this text content files. 

### Technical descripton of requirements
This a classic **“RAG” (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** use case — where the user uploads or writes content, and the AI answers questions based on that content, not just **pre-training**.

## 🧱 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### 🎯 Goal
Accept up to ~10 MB of user-generated content (posts + .txt files) and allow natural language Q&A on that content.

### 🗂️ 1. Frontend (User Input + Q&A UI)
**Stack:** Next.js (your preference), Tailwind UI

**Features:**
- File upload (.txt files)
- Rich-text editor or post submission input
- Chat-like Q&A interface with loading indicators

### 🧠 2. Backend API
**Stack:** FastAPI (Python) or Node.js

**Responsibilities:**
- Preprocessing user content
- Storing embeddings + metadata
- Calling vector search
- Calling OpenAI API (or custom model)
- Managing sessions + query history

### 🧾 3. Text Preprocessing + Chunking
- Chunk input into pieces of ~500–800 tokens
- Clean, normalize (remove headers, footers, HTML), and optionally tag with metadata (source, timestamp, file name)

### 🧬 4. Embeddings + Vector Storage
**Embedding Model:** text-embedding-3-small or text-embedding-ada-002 (OpenAI)

**Vector DB Options:**
- Pinecone (fully managed, fast)
- Weaviate or Qdrant (open source, local deployment)
- Chroma (for lightweight setups)

**Store:**
- Chunk text
- Embeddings
- Metadata (filename, section, etc.)

### 🤖 5. Question Answering Flow (RAG pipeline)
1. User asks question
2. Question is converted into embedding
3. Vector DB performs semantic similarity search over chunks
4. Top N chunks (e.g., top 4) are fed into a prompt to GPT-4 or GPT-4o
5. AI answers in natural language, citing source chunks if needed

| File Storage   | Local disk, AWS S3, or Supabase Storage                                     |
| Token Management| tiktoken (Python) or GPT tokenizer (JS)                                    |

## ⚙️ Optional Enhancements
- Add source highlighting (show which file/section was used in the answer)
- Add rate limits / usage tracking per user
- Enable chat memory per user
- Use LangChain or LlamaIndex to simplify RAG setup

---

## 🧪 Sample Flow
1. User uploads 10 .txt files → Files chunked & embedded → Embeddings stored in Vector DB
2. User asks question → Question embedded → Relevant chunks retrieved → Sent to GPT
3. Answer returned to user

---

## 🚀 Deployment Suggestions
- Use Docker to containerize backend
- Host backend on Render, Fly.io, or AWS EC2
- Use Supabase or Firebase for user auth if needed
