# User interface styling
Use only bootstrap. No hardcoded CSS.

# Documentation

- Each project folder or sub-directory has its own README.md. This is the primary file of that folder.
- README contains epics/stories implemented in that section   
- ✅ means this story or task is completed. Where there is a series of tasks, ✅ means that all the tasks mentioned before ✅ are completed. And all that are listed below are yet to do. 
- ❌ means that task/feature/story is developed but is failing. Before implementing new things, all ❌'s should be converted into ✅s.

- Write all titles in sentence case

# Coding standards
- Each file should clearly state the purpose, description, usage etc at the very top of the file

# File and directory names
1. Use - and not _ in naming `.md` files. For example: ✅ `product-standards.md` and not ❌ `product_standards.md`
