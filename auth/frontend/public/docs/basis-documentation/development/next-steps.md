# Next Steps


 - markdown pages should open with a URL in browser

- external links in markdown should open in new tab
- storage of notes in mongodb (or vector db)
- ability to ask questions on all stored notes  

# Plan (Component by Component):

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Set up basic project structure
   - ✅ Implement authentication system
   - Create basic database schema 
   - ✅ Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - **This gives us a solid foundation**

2. **Phase 2: Basic Content Management**
   - Basic content posting (text only)
   - ✅ Basic UI/UX

3. **Phase 3: AI Integration**
   - ✅ Set up OpenAI integration
   - ✅ Implement basic question answering
   - **This adds the AI layer**
   - **This gives us a working MVP**  

1. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
   - User record in db
   - User paymennts
      - as a user uses, his wallet goes into debt
      - user pay real money to me (initilly need not be online) to credit into his wallet
      - user can take some actions to credit money into his wallet (like use system, do quizes, etc) 
   - collect all info about users in the vector db
   - leanring module
      - Enter topic, goal, current user expertise and start the quiz
      - each right answer -> get points and more difficult question  
      - each wrong answer -> lose points, get explaination and then easier question
   - hiring module
      - as an HR I should be able to add JDs
      - CV should be assessed based on JD. Each cv gets added into db (vector db?)
      - written test and interview quiz to assess the candidate



   - Implement group creation and management
   - Simple file upload   
   - Add document embedding
   - Real-time updates
   - Advanced file handling
   - Enhanced AI capabilities
   - This polishes the product
